## Hi there ✨

My name is Gabriele Jandres and I'm 21 years old. I took IT course at CEFET and it was the main reason for the beginning of my passion for technology. Currently, I study Computer Science at UFRJ and I work as Tech Lead at EJCM, a junior computer enterprise at UFRJ. I am passionate about front-end development, but I am also very interested in the UI and UX Design area.

### Where will you find me?
